## Implementation Guidelines

### GitHub Integration
```python
from github import Github
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

class GitReviewBot:
    def __init__(self, github_token: str):
        self.github = Github(github_token)
        self.review_chain = self._setup_review_chain()
    
    async def handle_pr_event(self, payload: dict):
        """Handle GitHub PR webhook events"""
        if payload['action'] in ['opened', 'synchronize']:
            pr = self._get_pr_from_payload(payload)
            diff = self._get_pr_diff(pr)
            review = await self._analyze_code_changes(diff)
            await self._post_review_comments(pr, review)
    
    def _setup_review_chain(self):
        """Setup LangChain for code review analysis"""
        return LLMChain(
            llm=self.llm,
            prompt=self._get_review_prompt_template()
        )
```

### Review Analysis Engine
```typescript
interface ReviewAnalysis {
  security: SecurityIssue[]
  performance: PerformanceIssue[]
  style: StyleIssue[]
  suggestions: CodeSuggestion[]
  score: QualityScore
}

interface SecurityIssue {
  type: 'vulnerability' | 'exposure' | 'injection'
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
  file: string
  line: number
  description: string
  recommendation: string
  cwe?: string
}
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Webhook endpoint for GitHub events
POST /api/webhook/github
Headers: {
  "X-GitHub-Event": "pull_request",
  "X-Hub-Signature-256": "..."
}

// Manual review trigger
POST /api/review/{owner}/{repo}/{pull_number}
Response: {
  "reviewId": "uuid",
  "status": "completed",
  "findings": ReviewAnalysis,
  "postedComments": number
}
```

## Unique Differentiators

### Intelligent Context Awareness

## UI/UX Requirements

Follow the established design system from the main portfolio:

### Component Structure
```tsx
// Git review dashboard components
<ReviewDashboard>
  <PRList />                // Active pull requests
  <ReviewSummary />         // Overall metrics
  <SecurityAlerts />        // Security findings
  <PerformanceInsights />   // Performance suggestions
  <TeamMetrics />          // Team-wide statistics
</ReviewDashboard>
```

### Styling Guidelines
